# **App Name**: Health Insights Hub

## Core Features:

- Data Preprocessing API: Data Preprocessing API: Fast API endpoint to preprocess structured and unstructured healthcare data from EHR systems using Python (Pandas, NumPy, NLTK/Spacy).
- Risk Prediction API: Risk Prediction API: Expose the pre-trained ML model (Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, TensorFlow/PyTorch) via a FastAPI endpoint to predict disease risks and treatment outcomes.
- Explainability Insights: Explainability Insights Tool: Generate SHAP/LIME-based insights for each prediction. This is a tool incorporated in the Prediction API response to explain why a prediction was made.
- Risk Score API: Risk Score API: API endpoint that calculates and returns personalized risk scores for patients based on model predictions.
- Patient Profile API: Patient Profile API: Retrieve comprehensive patient data (lab reports, prescriptions, lifestyle factors) from the connected PostgreSQL database.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey trust and reliability.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5), a soft, neutral background to ensure readability and focus on the data.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) for key indicators and interactive elements, providing a complementary contrast to the primary blue.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, for clear and modern readability throughout the dashboard.
- Use a consistent set of healthcare-related icons in a minimalist style, with teal highlights to match the accent color.
- Dashboard layout should be clean and intuitive, focusing on presenting key risk scores and patient data clearly. Employ well-defined sections and prioritize important information.
